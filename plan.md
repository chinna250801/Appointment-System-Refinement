# Doctor Appointment System - Improvement & Restructure Plan ✅

## Current Issues Identified
- ✅ Backend API URL hardcoded to `127.0.0.1:8000` - FIXED
- ✅ Login/Register pages not role-specific - FIXED
- ✅ Customer/Patient flow needs separate simplified registration - FIXED
- ✅ Page navigation not role-based after login - FIXED
- ✅ No clear separation between admin, doctor, and patient workflows - FIXED

## Phase 1: Backend API Configuration & Environment Setup ✅
**Goal: Fix backend URL configuration and make it environment-aware**

- [x] Replace hardcoded `127.0.0.1:8000` with dynamic API URL configuration
- [x] Use Reflex's built-in API endpoint (`/api`) instead of external URL
- [x] Update all state files to use proper backend URL
- [x] Add environment variable support for API_URL if needed
- [x] Test API connectivity with proper URL configuration

---

## Phase 2: Authentication & Role-Based Access Control ✅
**Goal: Implement proper role-based authentication flow**

- [x] Create separate login pages for:
  - Admin/Doctor login (`/staff/login`) - for staff
  - Patient login (`/patient/login`) - for customers
- [x] Implement role-based redirects after successful login:
  - Admin → `/admin/dashboard`
  - Doctor → `/doctor/dashboard`
  - Patient → `/patient/dashboard`
- [x] Add simplified patient registration flow (no role selection needed)
- [x] Update admin/doctor registration to be admin-only functionality
- [x] Implement proper session management and token handling
- [x] Create landing page with Patient Portal and Staff Portal options
- [x] Test all authentication flows and UI components

---

## Phase 3: Role-Based Page Navigation & Dashboard Structure ✅
**Goal: Create distinct user experiences for each role**

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin/*`) ✅
- [x] Dashboard overview with statistics (total patients, appointments, doctors)
- [x] Department management (create, edit, view departments)
- [x] Doctor management (create, edit, delete doctors, assign departments)
- [x] Patient management (view all patients, search, filter)
- [x] Appointment management (view all appointments, filter by date/doctor/patient)
- [x] System settings and configuration
- [x] Responsive sidebar navigation

### Doctor Dashboard (`/doctor/*`) ✅
- [x] Personal dashboard with today's appointments
- [x] Appointment calendar view (week/month view)
- [x] Availability management (set working hours by day)
- [x] Patient appointment history and notes
- [x] Profile management (update contact info, specialization)
- [x] Sidebar navigation for doctor pages

### Patient Dashboard (`/patient/*`) ✅
- [x] Upcoming appointments view with details
- [x] Appointment history (past appointments)
- [x] Book new appointment (multi-step: select department → doctor → date/time)
- [x] Cancel/reschedule appointments
- [x] Profile management (update contact details)
- [x] Clean navigation between patient pages

## Technical Stack & Architecture

### Frontend (Reflex) ✅
- Material Design 3 principles with Montserrat font
- Violet primary color (#6200EA), gray secondary
- Responsive layouts with proper elevation system
- Card-based UI with proper shadows and spacing

### Backend (Reflex API) ✅
- Built-in Reflex API routes (`/api/*`)
- JWT authentication with role-based access
- SQLModel ORM with PostgreSQL
- Proper error handling and validation

### Authentication Flow ✅
```
Public Pages:
  / (landing) → Choose: Patient Portal or Staff Portal
  /patient/login → Patient login
  /patient/register → Patient registration
  /staff/login → Staff (Admin/Doctor) login

Protected Pages (Auto-redirect based on role):
  Admin → /admin/dashboard
  Doctor → /doctor/dashboard  
  Patient → /patient/dashboard
```

---

## Implementation Notes

### API URL Strategy ✅
- Using relative URLs (`/api/departments`) since Reflex serves API on same domain
- Removed hardcoded `127.0.0.1:8000` references
- Centralized configuration in `app/config.py`

### Role Management ✅
- Admin: Full system access (departments, doctors, patients, all appointments)
- Doctor: Own appointments, availability, patient records
- Patient: Own appointments, booking, profile
- JWT tokens with role-based claims

### Security Considerations ✅
- JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
- Role validation on both frontend (UI) and backend (API)
- Protected routes with automatic redirect
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Token expiration (60 minutes)
