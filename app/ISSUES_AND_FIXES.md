### 1. Critical Issue: Database Model Relationship Error

-   **Problem:** The application would crash on startup or when querying the database due to a misconfiguration in the SQLModel relationships. The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Mapper 'Mapper[Appointment(appointment)]' has no property 'appointments'` indicated a broken link between the `Patient` and `Appointment` models.
-   **Root Cause:** In `app/models.py`, the `Appointment` model's `patient` relationship was correctly defined with `back_populates="appointments"`. However, the `Patient` model's corresponding `appointments` relationship had an incorrect `back_populates="appointments"`. It was pointing to itself instead of the `patient` property in the `Appointment` model.
-   **Fix:**
    -   The `back_populates` argument in the `Patient` model's `appointments` relationship was corrected from `"appointments"` to `"patient"`.
    -   **File:** `app/models.py`
    -   **Before:**
        
        class Patient(SQLModel, table=True):
            # ...
            appointments: list["Appointment"] = Relationship(back_populates="appointments") # Incorrect
        
    -   **After:**
        
        class Patient(SQLModel, table=True):
            # ...
            appointments: list["Appointment"] = Relationship(back_populates="patient") # Correct
        
-   **Result:** This fix resolved the SQLAlchemy mapping error, allowing the database schema to be correctly configured and enabling proper queries across related tables.

### 2. Critical Issue: Authentication Navigation Loop

-   **Problem:** After logging in, users were immediately redirected back to the landing page (`/`), creating an infinite loop if they tried to access their dashboards. Clicking "Patient Portal" or "Staff Portal" from the landing page also resulted in an immediate redirect back to `/`.
-   **Root Cause:** The `check_auth` event handler in `app/auth.py` had flawed logic. It did not correctly handle the case where an authenticated user was already on the landing page. It would see an authenticated user on `/` and immediately try to redirect them to their dashboard, but another part of the logic would then force them back to `/`.
-   **Fix:**
    -   The logic in the `check_auth` method was refactored to be more robust and cover all authentication states and page routes correctly.
    -   A check was added to prevent redirects if the user is already on a public page and is not authenticated.
    -   The redirect logic for authenticated users on the landing page was clarified to ensure they are sent to the correct dashboard without a conflicting rule sending them back.
    -   **File:** `app/auth.py`
-   **Result:** The navigation loop is fixed. Authenticated users are now correctly redirected to their respective dashboards and can navigate the site freely. Unauthenticated users are properly restricted to public pages.

### 3. Issue: Unresponsive API and Lack of User Feedback

-   **Problem:** During login or registration, if an error occurred (e.g., wrong password, user exists), the UI would not provide any feedback. The API calls seemed to fail silently, leaving the user confused.
-   **Root Cause:** The event handlers for login and registration in `app/auth.py` were missing user-facing feedback mechanisms like toast notifications for error conditions.
-   **Fix:**
    -   `rx.toast.error()` notifications were added to all failure paths within the `staff_login`, `patient_login`, and `patient_register` event handlers.
    -   These toasts provide clear, actionable feedback to the user (e.g., "Invalid credentials," "Username already taken.").
    -   **File:** `app/auth.py`
-   **Result:** The user experience is significantly improved. The application now provides immediate and clear feedback for both successful and failed authentication attempts.

### 4. Issue: Missing Admin Functionality

-   **Problem:** The admin sidebar contained links to "Patients" and "Appointments" management pages (`/admin/patients`, `/admin/appointments`), but these pages were placeholders and lacked any real functionality.
-   **Root Cause:** The pages were defined in `app/app.py` but were only rendering a simple heading. The necessary state management and UI components for CRUD operations were not implemented.
-   **Fix:**
    -   Created a new state file `app/states/admin_state.py` to manage the data and logic for all admin pages.
    -   Implemented event handlers to fetch, add, update, and delete patients and view appointments.
    -   Built out the UI components for `admin_patients_page` and `admin_appointments_page` with tables, forms, and dialogs to provide full CRUD functionality.
    -   **Files:** `app/app.py`, `app/states/admin_state.py`
-   **Result:** The admin role is now fully functional. Administrators can manage patients and view appointments as intended.

### 5. Issue: Missing Name Field in Registration Form

-   **Problem**: The backend API expects a "name" field for patient registration, but the frontend form did not include it, causing API validation errors.
-   **Root Cause**: There was a mismatch between the `RegisterRequest` Pydantic schema in the backend and the fields defined in the `patient_register_page` component in the frontend.
-   **Fix**: An input field for "Full Name" was added to the `patient_register_page` function in `app/app.py`, ensuring the `form_data` sent to the API includes the required `name` field.
-   **File**: `app/app.py`
-   **Result**: The patient registration form now correctly captures all required information, allowing new users to register successfully without backend validation errors.
