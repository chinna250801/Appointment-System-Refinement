## 1. System Overview

The system is designed as a modern, decoupled web application with a pure Python stack. It separates concerns between the user interface (frontend), business logic (backend), and data persistence (database).

### High-Level Architecture

        +--- (HTTPS/API Calls) ------+


-   **Frontend**: A Reflex application that runs in the user's browser, providing a rich, interactive user interface.
-   **Backend**: A FastAPI server that exposes a RESTful API. It handles all business logic, data processing, and authentication.
-   **Database**: A PostgreSQL database that stores all application data, from user credentials to appointment details.

### Communication Patterns

-   **Frontend to Backend**: All communication is done via asynchronous HTTP requests from the Reflex frontend to the FastAPI backend. An API client (`httpx`) centralizes this communication.
-   **Backend to Database**: The backend uses async SQLAlchemy with `asyncpg` to perform non-blocking database queries, ensuring high throughput.

## 2. Frontend Architecture (Reflex)

The frontend is built entirely in Python using the Reflex framework, eliminating the need for JavaScript and enabling a seamless development experience.

-   **Component Structure**: The UI is composed of granular, reusable components. Major UI sections like the sidebar (`admin_sidebar`) and auth forms (`_auth_form`) are defined in their own modules for clarity.
-   **State Management**: UI state and client-side logic are managed in `rx.State` classes. This includes UI toggles (e.g., modal visibility), user input, and data fetched from the backend.
-   **Page Routing**: Reflex's file-based routing and `app.add_page` are used to map URL routes to page-building functions (e.g., `/admin/dashboard` maps to `admin_dashboard_page`).
-   **Event Handlers & Data Flow**:
    1.  User interacts with a UI element (e.g., `on_click`).
    2.  The event trigger calls an `EventHandler` in a `State` class.
    3.  The handler, now running on the server side, calls the `APIClient`.
    4.  The `APIClient` makes an HTTP request to the FastAPI backend.
    5.  Upon receiving a response, the handler updates its state variables.
    6.  Reflex automatically propagates the state changes to the frontend, re-rendering only the necessary components.
-   **API Client Design**: The `APIClient` class in `app/api_client.py` abstracts all backend communication. It is responsible for setting the base URL, injecting the JWT authentication token into headers, and handling HTTP errors.

**Why Reflex?**
-   **Pure Python**: Allows for a unified Python-only codebase, simplifying the development stack and reducing context-switching.
-   **Component-Based**: Encourages building a modular and maintainable UI.
-   **Integrated State Management**: State changes on the backend are automatically reflected on the frontend, simplifying UI updates.

## 3. Backend Architecture (FastAPI)

The backend is a high-performance, asynchronous API built with FastAPI.

-   **Router Organization**: Endpoints are grouped logically into `APIRouter` modules (`auth`, `patients`, `doctors`, etc.) within the `app/backend/routers` directory. This keeps the main application file clean and organized.
-   **Database Layer**: We use `SQLModel` for Pydantic-based data models that double as SQLAlchemy ORM classes. This provides type-safe, validated data from the database to the API response. All database sessions are asynchronous (`AsyncSession`).
-   **Authentication Middleware**: JWT-based authentication is implemented using `fastapi.security.HTTPBearer`. A dependency (`get_current_user`) decodes the token from the `Authorization` header and fetches the user from the database for every protected request.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Specialized dependency functions (`get_admin_user`, `get_staff_user`) are used to protect endpoints. These dependencies build on `get_current_user` and raise a `403 Forbidden` HTTPException if the user's role does not match the requirement.
-   **Async/Await**: The entire backend stack is asynchronous, from the route handlers down to the database calls, enabling it to handle many concurrent requests efficiently.

**Why FastAPI?**
-   **Performance**: One of the fastest Python web frameworks available.
-   **Async First**: Built from the ground up for asynchronous programming.
-   **Automatic Docs**: Generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI), which is invaluable for development and testing.
-   **Dependency Injection**: Simplifies managing dependencies like database sessions and authentication.

## 4. Database Design

The schema is designed using SQLModel with clear relationships to ensure data integrity.

-   **Entity Relationships**:
    -   `User` -> `Doctor` (One-to-One)
    -   `User` -> `Patient` (One-to-One)
    -   `Department` -> `Doctor` (One-to-Many)
    -   `Doctor` -> `Appointment` (One-to-Many)
    -   `Patient` -> `Appointment` (One-to-Many)
    -   `Doctor` -> `Availability` (One-to-Many)
-   **`User` Model**: The central model for authentication. It holds the `username`, hashed `password`, and `role`. It is linked to a `Doctor` or `Patient` profile to separate authentication from profile data.
-   **Indexing Strategy**: Indexes are automatically created on primary keys. Unique constraints on `User.username` and `Patient.email` create indexes that speed up lookups during login and registration.

---

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

-   **JWT Token Flow**:
    1.  User submits credentials to `/api/auth/login`.
    2.  FastAPI validates credentials, and if successful, generates a JWT containing the user's `sub` (username) and `role`.
    3.  The token is returned to the Reflex frontend.
-   **Cookie-Based Token Storage**: The Reflex `AuthState` stores the received JWT in a browser `rx.Cookie`. This provides persistence across page loads and browser sessions.
-   **Password Hashing**: Passwords are never stored in plaintext. They are hashed using `bcrypt` before being saved to the database.
-   **Role Enforcement**: Dependencies like `Depends(get_admin_user)` are added to route signatures in FastAPI. This code runs before the main route logic, validating the user's role and returning a `403 Forbidden` error if access is denied.

---

## 6. State Management (Reflex)

-   **`AuthState`**: The global source of truth for authentication. It manages the `token`, `user_info`, and contains the `check_auth` `on_load` handler that protects all frontend routes.
-   **`AdminState`**: Scoped to the admin section. It handles fetching and managing admin-specific data like the list of all patients. It also defines the structure of the admin sidebar.
-   **`CalendarState`**: A complex state that manages the entire calendar UI. It contains the logic for generating the calendar grid, creating slots from templates, and handling UI interactions like opening modals.
-   **State Sharing**: States can access other states using `await self.get_state(OtherState)`, which allows, for example, `AdminState` to access the auth `token` from `AuthState` when making API calls.

---

## 7. Calendar System Design

The calendar is a core feature with sophisticated logic for generating and managing availability.

-   **Slot Generation Algorithm**: The `_generate_time_slots` method in `CalendarState` is a pure function that takes a date and an availability template. It iterates from the `start_time` to the `end_time`, creating discrete slots based on the `slot_duration` and ensuring no duplicates are created for existing slots.
-   **Availability Template System**: Admins define a simple template (`weekdays`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `slot_duration`). This template is then applied to every valid day of a month to generate a full schedule of available slots.
-   **6-Month Future Limit**: The `_validate_month_limit` check prevents the generation of calendars more than six months in the future. This is a business rule to prevent indefinite booking and keep the dataset manageable.
-   **Time Zone Considerations**: All datetimes are stored in UTC format on the backend (as ISO strings). The frontend is responsible for rendering them in the user's local timezone.

---

## 8. API Design Principles (FastAPI)

-   **RESTful Conventions**: The API follows REST principles, using standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) and resource-based URLs (e.g., `/api/patients/{patient_id}`).
-   **Pydantic Schemas**: Separate Pydantic models are used for request bodies (`...Create`, `...Update`) and responses (`...Response`). This ensures that only safe, validated data is exposed and that clients receive a consistent data structure.
-   **HTTP Status Codes**: The API uses appropriate status codes: `200` for success, `201` for creation, `204` for successful deletion, `400` for bad requests, `401` for unauthorized, `403` for forbidden, `404` for not found, and `500` for internal errors.
-   **Error Response Format**: FastAPI's default error response format `{ "detail": "Error message" }` is used for consistency.

---

## 9. Security Considerations

-   **SQL Injection**: Prevented by using the SQLAlchemy ORM, which parameterizes all queries.
-   **XSS Prevention**: Reflex automatically escapes rendered data, mitigating Cross-Site Scripting risks.
-   **CSRF Protection**: Reflex includes built-in CSRF protection for all state-mutating events.
-   **CORS Configuration**: The FastAPI backend is configured with a strict list of allowed origins to prevent unauthorized websites from making API requests.
-   **Secret Management**: The `SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` are loaded from environment variables and are never hardcoded in the source code.

---

## 10. Scalability & Performance

-   **Async Architecture**: The end-to-end async stack (Uvicorn -> FastAPI -> SQLAlchemy -> `asyncpg`) ensures the application is I/O-bound and can handle a high number of concurrent connections without blocking.
-   **Database Connection Pooling**: SQLAlchemy's async engine manages a pool of database connections, reducing the overhead of establishing a new connection for every request.
-   **Frontend State Optimization**: Reflex's fine-grained reactivity ensures that only the parts of the UI that depend on a changed state variable are re-rendered, minimizing DOM updates.

---

## 11. Code Organization

-   **File Structure**: The project is organized by feature and domain, with clear separation between the frontend app (`app/`), the backend API (`app/backend/`), components (`app/components/`), states (`app/states/`), and data models (`app/models.py`). This makes the codebase easy to navigate and maintain.
-   **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend UI logic, client-side state, backend business logic, and database models are all in separate modules, adhering to the single-responsibility principle.

---

## 12. Future Enhancements

-   **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSockets to push real-time updates to the frontend (e.g., when a slot is booked by another user).
-   **Email/SMS Notifications**: Integrate with a service like SendGrid or Twilio to send appointment confirmations and reminders.
-   **Payment Integration**: Add a payment gateway like Stripe to handle payments for bookings.
-   **Multi-tenancy**: Evolve the data model to support multiple, isolated businesses on the same platform.
