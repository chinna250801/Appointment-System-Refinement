## üìä Project Status

The project is approximately **65% complete**. The core backend API, frontend shell, state management, and calendar generation logic are fully functional.

-   **Phase 1-4 (App Shell, Backend, State, Calendar):** ‚úÖ Complete
-   **Phase 5-7 (Booking Flow, Profiles, Admin CRUD):** üöß In Progress

For a detailed breakdown of completed features, remaining work, and project milestones, please see the **[Project Status Document](PROJECT_STATUS.md)**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the application running locally.

bash
# 1. Install dependencies from the root directory
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start the backend server
# (Ensure you are in the root directory, then run the create_admin script)
python -m app.backend.create_admin
# Follow the prompts to create your admin user.
# Now, start the server:
uvicorn app.backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

# 3. Start the frontend application (in a new terminal)
reflex run


The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend API docs will be at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## ‚úÖ Key Features (Currently Working)

-   **User Authentication**: Patients can register, and all users can log in and out securely.
-   **Role-Based Access**: The app correctly redirects users to their respective dashboards (Admin, Doctor, Patient) and protects routes.
-   **Calendar Generation**: Admins can go to `/admin/calendar`, select a provider, and generate a full month of appointment slots from an availability template.
-   **Admin Dashboard**: A functional admin area with a sidebar for navigation.

## üéØ Next Steps

The next priorities are to build out the remaining user-facing features:

1.  **Customer Booking Flow**: Implement the UI for patients to browse providers and book available slots.
2.  **Appointment Management**: Create pages for users to view and manage their upcoming and past appointments.
3.  **Profile Pages**: Build out detailed profile pages for customers and providers.
4.  **Admin CRUD Interfaces**: Complete the UI for managing departments, doctors, and patients.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

The application requires the following environment variables to be set in a `.env` file in the root directory.

-   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your database.
-   `SECRET_KEY`: A long, random string for signing JWT tokens.
-   `CORS_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed frontend URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
-   `BACKEND_API_URL`: The URL of the running backend (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

See `.env.example` for a template.
