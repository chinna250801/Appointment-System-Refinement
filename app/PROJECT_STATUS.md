# Enterprise Appointment Booking System - Project Status

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 24, 2024

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Enterprise Appointment Booking System, a full-stack application built with a Python-based Reflex frontend and a FastAPI backend. The project's goal is to deliver a robust, multi-tenant, and role-based platform for managing medical or service-based appointments.

- **Project:** Enterprise-grade appointment booking system.
- **Current Status:** **~65% Complete**
- **Key Achievements:**
    - ✅ A fully functional, standalone FastAPI backend with 30+ endpoints is complete.
    - ✅ Complete JWT-based authentication and role-based access control (Admin, Doctor, Patient) is implemented and working.
    - ✅ The frontend app shell, navigation, and all core pages are built and responsive.
    - ✅ The complex calendar management feature, including dynamic slot generation from availability templates, is fully functional.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The system is designed with a modern, decoupled architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and a clean separation of concerns.

- **Frontend:**
    - **Framework:** [Reflex](https://reflex.dev/) (pure Python)
    - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via `reflex.plugins.TailwindV3Plugin`)
    - **Communication:** Asynchronous API calls via an `httpx`-based API client.

- **Backend:**
    - **Framework:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
    - **ORM & Validation:** SQLModel (built on SQLAlchemy and Pydantic)
    - **Async:** Fully asynchronous from the database to the API endpoints.

- **Database:**
    - **Production:** PostgreSQL (recommended)
    - **Development:** SQLite (for ease of setup)

- **Authentication:**
    - **Mechanism:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with Bearer token scheme.
    - **Password Hashing:** `bcrypt` for secure password storage.

## 3. Completed Features (Phases 1-4)

#### ✅ Phase 1: App Shell & Navigation (100% Complete)
- Responsive app layout with a header and a collapsible sidebar.
- Complete navigation structure with icons and active-state highlighting.
- All pages and routes are defined (`/admin/dashboard`, `/patient/login`, etc.).
- Role-based redirection logic prevents unauthorized page access.

#### ✅ Phase 2: Data Models & Backend API (100% Complete)
- All data models (`User`, `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Appointment`, etc.) are defined using SQLModel.
- A complete, production-ready FastAPI backend with **30+ endpoints** for CRUD operations on all resources.
- API documentation automatically generated via Swagger UI (`/docs`).
- Comprehensive role-based endpoint protection (e.g., only Admins can create Doctors).

#### ✅ Phase 3: State Management & Business Logic (100% Complete)
- `AuthState`: Manages user login, logout, token storage (in cookies), and authorization checks.
- `AdminState`: Handles data fetching and UI state for the admin section.
- `CalendarState`: Contains all the complex logic for calendar generation, slot creation, and availability management.
- Core business rules, such as the 6-month booking limit, are implemented and validated.

#### ✅ Phase 4: Calendar Page UI & Interactions (100% Complete)
- A fully interactive calendar page (`/admin/calendar`).
- **Controls:** Select a provider and navigate between months.
- **Month View:** A grid-based calendar displaying days and the time slots within them.
- **Availability Modal:** Admins can define a weekly template (working days, hours, slot duration) to generate a month's worth of available slots for a provider.
- **Slot Detail Modal:** Clicking a slot shows its details (date, time, status).

## 4. What Works Right Now (A Testable Snapshot)

- **User Authentication:** Users can register as patients or log in as staff (Admin/Doctor). The system correctly issues JWTs and stores them in cookies.
- **Role-Based Access:** After logging in, users are redirected to their correct dashboards (`/admin/dashboard`, `/doctor/dashboard`, `/patient/dashboard`). Attempting to access a page reserved for another role results in a redirect.
- **Protected Routes:** Unauthenticated users are redirected to login pages if they try to access any protected area.
- **Calendar Generation:** An administrator can navigate to `/admin/calendar`, select a provider, and generate a full month of appointment slots based on a defined weekly schedule.
- **API & Database:** The frontend successfully communicates with the backend API, which in turn interacts with the database to create and retrieve data.

## 5. Remaining Work (Phases 5-7)

- **[ ] Phase 5: Customer Booking Flow**
    - UI for customers to browse providers, view their availability, and book an appointment.
    - Implement the frontend logic to call the `book_slot` API endpoint.
    - Build the customer-facing "My Appointments" page.

- **[ ] Phase 6: Profile Pages**
    - Customer profile page with appointment history.
    - Doctor/Provider profile page with metrics and schedule overview.

- **[ ] Phase 7: Admin CRUD Features**
    - Build out the UI for the admin pages that are currently placeholders:
        - Department Management (`/admin/departments`)
        - Doctor Management (`/admin/doctors`)
        - Patient Management (`/admin/patients`)
        - Appointment Management (`/admin/appointments`)

## 6. How to Test the Current System

1.  **Start the System:**
    - Run the backend: `uvicorn app.backend.main:app --reload --port 8000`
    - Create an admin user: `python -m app.backend.create_admin`
    - Run the frontend: `reflex run`

2.  **Test Authentication:**
    - Go to `http://localhost:3000/staff/login`.
    - Log in with the admin credentials you created.
    - **Expected:** You should be redirected to `/admin/dashboard`.

3.  **Test Calendar Generation:**
    - From the admin dashboard, click "Calendar" in the sidebar to navigate to `/admin/calendar`.
    - Click the **"Generate Calendar"** button.
    - The "Create Calendar for Month" modal will appear.
    - Keep the default settings (Mon-Fri, 9-5, 30 min slots) and click **"Generate Slots"**.
    - **Expected:** The modal will close, and the calendar for the current month will be populated with green "available" slots.

4.  **Test Navigation & Authorization:**
    - While logged in as an admin, try to access `/patient/dashboard`.
    - **Expected:** You should be automatically redirected back to `/admin/dashboard`.
    - Log out using the button in the sidebar.
    - Try to access `/admin/dashboard` directly.
    - **Expected:** You should be redirected to the `/staff/login` page.

## 8. Next Steps

#### Immediate Priorities:
1.  **Implement Admin CRUD for Patients:** Build out the `/admin/patients` page to display the patient list fetched from the API.
2.  **Customer Booking UI:** Create the UI for a patient to select a provider and view available slots.
3.  **Implement `book_slot` Frontend Logic:** Connect the booking UI to the `book_slot` API endpoint.

#### Future Enhancements:
- Implement real-time notifications for appointment confirmations.
- Integrate with Google Calendar for providers.
- Develop a comprehensive reporting and analytics dashboard.
- Add multi-language support.
